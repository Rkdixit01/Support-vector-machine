# Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Classifier and Regressor with Kernel Options
This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for both classification and regression tasks. The project includes multiple kernel options to capture different data patterns and decision boundaries, enabling the model to address both linearly and non-linearly separable data.

# Project Overview
Support Vector Machine is a versatile supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression. By applying kernel functions—such as linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF)—SVM models can create complex decision boundaries and fit data points accurately in feature space. This flexibility allows SVM to handle diverse data structures effectively.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to build SVM models that perform classification and regression with high accuracy. Through kernel functions, the models adapt to various data complexities, achieving robust results for both linearly and non-linearly distributed data.

# Today's Work
Implemented SVM Classifier and Regressor using Python and essential libraries.
Integrated multiple kernel options (linear, polynomial, RBF) to explore their effects on model performance.
Trained the models on sample datasets, optimized parameters, and visualized decision boundaries and regression curves for each kernel type.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
# Libraries: numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas
